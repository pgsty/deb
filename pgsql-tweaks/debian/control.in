Description: Contains PostgreSQL functions which I regularly needed.
  The functions and views published in this repository are some of those, which I regularly need in my daily job.
  As these procedures are sort of essential, at least to me, I install them in the public schema. That way they are available for everyone without having to know a schema name.
