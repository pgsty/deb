Description: Short unique id generator for PostgreSQL PGVERSION
  Hashids is a small open-source library that generates short, unique, non-sequential ids from numbers.
  It converts numbers like 347 into strings like “yr8”. You can also decode those ids back.
  This is useful in bundling several parameters into one or simply using them as short UIDs.
