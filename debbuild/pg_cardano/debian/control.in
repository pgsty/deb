Description: A PostgreSQL extension providing a suite of Cardano-related tools, including cryptographic functions, address encoding/decoding, and blockchain data processing.
  This extension is an attempt to create a Swiss Army knife for simplifying the work with binary data in Cardano db-sync, as well as automating some processes.
  It is written in Rust, which ensures high security and excellent performance.
  The extension is designed to handle unforeseen errors gracefully, without causing any disruptions in the database's operation. All errors are safely propagated as PostgreSQL-level error messages.
