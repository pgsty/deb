Description: PostgreSQL extension which provides persistent logging within transactions and functions.
  pg_jobmon is a PostgreSQL extension designed to add autonomous logging capabilities to transactions and functions.
  The logging is done in a NON-TRANSACTIONAL method, so that if your function/transaction fails for any reason,
  any information written to that point will be kept in the log tables rather than rolled back.
