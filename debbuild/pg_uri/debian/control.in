Description: The URI data type for PostgreSQL
  This is an extension for PostgreSQL that provides a uri data type. Advantages over using plain text for storing URIs include:
  URI syntax checking, functions for extracting URI components, human-friendly sorting
  The actual URI parsing is provided by the uriparser library, which supports URI syntax as per RFC 3986.
  Note that this might not be the right data type to use if you want to store user-provided URI data, such as HTTP referrers, since they might contain arbitrary junk.
