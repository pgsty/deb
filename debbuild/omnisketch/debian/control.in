Description: omnisketch implemented as Postgres extension
  This PostgreSQL extension implements OmniSketch, a data structure for on-line aggregation of data into approximate sketch,
   and answering queries. The algorithm is also very friendly to parallel programs.
  The OmniSketch data structure was introduced by this paper:
  OmniSketch: Efficient Multi-Dimensional High-Velocity Stream Analytics with Arbitrary Predicates;
