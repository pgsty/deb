Description: Periodically or randomly crash your database
  If your database is too reliable - pg_crash can kill it for you.
  pg_crash is an extension to PostgreSQL, which allows you to periodically or randomly crash your database
  infrastructure by sending kill (or other) signals to your DB processes and make them fail. It is ideal for HA and failover testing.
