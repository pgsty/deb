Description: Postgres extension for fast select & append of float arrays.
  A Postgres extension to store float arrays in individual files, providing very fast querying
  (especially when combined with aggs_for_arrays, aggs_for_vecs, or floatvec) without paying a huge cost to keep updating them.
  The idea is that if you have 1 million FLOATs, it is much faster if you can load them as a single 8 MB chunk rather than
  pulling from a million different places on disk. Sometimes you can just store your data as an array in a regular Postgres table,
  but updating those arrays will be slow and cause painful MVCC churn. Since this extension keeps the data in a separate file,
  appends are very fast and outside the MVCC system.
