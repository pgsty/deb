Description: A Postgres extension in C to compute statistics on arrays of numbers
  This Postgres extension provides various functions for operating on arrays, for instance taking the histogram of an array of numbers.
  These functions are useful because if you have a lot values you want to aggregate, queries that fetch each value from a separate row
  can have poor performance. Storing all the values in a single row as a Postgres array can drastically improve query performance.
  For instance, computing a 1000-bucket histogram on one million float values stored in separate rows took 12 seconds in a simple benchmark,
  compared to 27 milliseconds with the array_to_hist function.
