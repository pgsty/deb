Description: PostgreSQL Extension: More friendly system catalog for PostgreSQL
  System catalogs are great, because they provide a data-centric view into the database's structure.
  PostgreSQL has two system catalogs, pg_catalog and information_schema, but each have some drawbacks.
  pg_catalog mirrors PostgreSQL's internal structure, and centers around oid, object identifiers that
  aren't intended for "above the hood" developers to know or care about. information_schema is part of the SQL standard,
  and is filled with many views and columns that don't match PostgreSQL's terminology or features.
  The goals with meta is to provide an "above the hood" system catalog for PostgreSQL
  that is normalized and uses common names for views and columns.
