Description: Store execution plans like pg_stat_statements does for queries.
  The pg_store_plans module provides a means for tracking execution plan statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server.
  The module must be loaded by adding pg_store_plans to shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf, because it requires additional shared memory. This means that a server restart is required to add or remove the module. pg_store_plans requires the GUC variable compute_query_id to be "on" or "auto". If it is set to "no", pg_store_plans is silently disabled.
