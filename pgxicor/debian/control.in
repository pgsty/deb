Description: XI Correlation Coefficient in Postgres
  pgxicor is a Postgres extension that exposes a SELECT xicor(X, Y) aggregate function.
  XI can detect functional relationships between X and Y.
  You can use it as a more powerful alternative to standard corr(X, Y) which works best on linear relationships only.
