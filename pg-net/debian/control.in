Description: Make async HTTP/HTTPS requests in PostgreSQL PGVERSION
  The `pg_net` extension enables PostgreSQL to make asynchronous HTTP/HTTPS requests in SQL.
  It eliminates the need for servers to continuously poll for database changes and instead allows the database to proactively notify external resources about significant events.
  It seamlessly integrates with triggers, cron jobs (e.g., PG_CRON), and procedures, unlocking numerous possibilities.
  Notably, `pg_net` powers Supabase's Webhook functionality, highlighting its robustness and reliability.
