Description: Construct High-Performance SQL Cluster Engine for distributed big data
  If you get data compressed as bzip2, whether through HTTP or from a file,
  pgspider_ext enables PostgreSQL to access a number of data sources using
  Foreign Data Wrapper(FDW) and retrieves the distributed data source vertically.
  Code of pgspider_ext is one of extension of PostgreSQL. We call PostgreSQL installed pgspider_ext as "PGSpider".
  Usage of PostgreSQL installed pgspider_ext is the same as PostgreSQL. You can use any client applications such as libpq and psql.
