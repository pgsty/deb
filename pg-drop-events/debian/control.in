Description: logs transaction ids of drop table, drop column, drop materialized view statements to aid point in time recovery
  pg_drop_events is a PostgreSQL extension that logs transaction ids of drop table, drop column, drop materialized view statements to aid point in time recovery.
  To perform point in time recovery in case of a disaster whereby a table or a table column was mistakenly dropped, you simply specify the xact_id you get from the pg_drop_events table as the recovery_target_xid. For more information, see user guide.
