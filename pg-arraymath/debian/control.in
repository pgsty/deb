Description: Access Control Lists (pg-arraymath) PostgreSQL Extension
  You need this extension if you want to restrict access to rows in tables based on an authenticated user.
  Access Control List (pg-arraymath) has become the de-facto standard for implementing a security model in modern applications.
  Complex scenarios can be handled by using pg-arraymaths without having a complex permission model at the application level.
