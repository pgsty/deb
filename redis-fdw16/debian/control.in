Description: A PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper for Redis
  This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for the Redis key/value database: http://redis.io/
  This code was originally experimental, and largely intended as a pet project for Dave to experiment with and learn about FDWs in PostgreSQL. It has now been extended for production use by Andrew.
  By all means use it, but do so entirely at your own risk! You have been warned!
