Description: A PostgreSQL extension for a time based duration type.
  pg_duration is a PostgreSQL extension that adds a duration data type to PostgreSQL.
  duration allows users to store the total time of some event in their databases.
  duration is very similar to the builtin interval type, except duration does not have a months or days component, only a microsecond component.
