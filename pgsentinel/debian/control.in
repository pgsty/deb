Description: postgresql extension providing Active session history
  PostgreSQL provides session activity. However, in order to gather activity behavior,
  users have to sample the pg_stat_activity view multiple times. pgsentinel is an extension to
  record active session history and link the activity with query statistics (pg_stat_statements).
