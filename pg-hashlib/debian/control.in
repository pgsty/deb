Description: Stable hash functions for Postgres
  The goal of pghashlib is to provide stable hashes for PostgeSQL, "stable" in the sense that their implementation does not change, they are independent from PostgeSQL version.
  Some string hashes may be dependent on CPU architecture, so that they return different return on big-endian architecture from little-endian architecture. It you want to be architectures-independent, then use algorithms that don't depend on endianess.
