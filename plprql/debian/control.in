Description: PL/PRQL is a PostgreSQL extension that lets you write functions with PRQL.
  PRQL (Pipelined Relational Query Language) is an open source query language for data manipulation and analysis that compiles to SQL.
  PRQL introduces a pipeline concept (similar to Unix pipes) that transforms data line-by-line. The sequential series of transformations
  reduces the complexity often encountered with nested SQL queries and makes your data manipulation logic easier to read and write.
