Description: pg_background is an extension for Postgres PGVERSION
  Initially this extension was shared by Robert Haas in PostgreSQL community for demo purpose.
  Some modification has been done, by me, to keep it in sync with latest version of Postgres version >=9.5.
  Extra error handling and command results has been added.
