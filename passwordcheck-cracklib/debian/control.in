Description: passwordcheck_cracklib - strengthen PostgreSQL user password checks with cracklib
  The passwordcheck_cracklib is like the regular PostgreSQL passwordcheck extension, except it is built with cracklib. Unlike the original module, this one has more strict password checks.
  The passwordcheck_cracklib module checks users' passwords whenever they are set with CREATE ROLE or ALTER ROLE. If a password is considered too weak, it will be rejected and the command will terminate with an error.
