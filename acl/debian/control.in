Description: Access Control Lists (ACL) PostgreSQL Extension
  You need this extension if you want to restrict access to rows in tables based on an authenticated user.
  Access Control List (ACL) has become the de-facto standard for implementing a security model in modern applications.
  Complex scenarios can be handled by using ACLs without having a complex permission model at the application level.
