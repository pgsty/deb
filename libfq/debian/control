Description: A wrapper library for Firebird's C API, loosely based on PostgreSQL's libpq
  libfq provides a number of functions which act as convenience wrappers around the native Firebird C API, which is cumbersome to use.
  It is loosely based on PostgreSQL's libpq and provides a subset of that API's functions - names beginning with FQ rather than PQ - with more-or-less identical function signatures. It also provides some Firebird-specific functions.
  While basically functional, libfq is still work-in-progress and the API definitions may change between releases in an incompatible way. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
