Description: Extension for storing encrypted secrets in the Vault in PostgreSQL PGVERSION
  Supabase provides a table called vault.secrets that can be used to store sensitive information like API keys.
  These secrets will be stored in an encrypted format on disk and in any database dumps.
  This is often called Encryption At Rest. Decrypting this table is done through a special database
  view called vault.decrypted_secrets that uses an encryption key that is itself not avaiable to SQL,
  but can be referred to by ID. Supabase manages these internal keys for you, so you can't leak them out of the database, you can only refer to them by their ids.
