Description: PostgreSQL extension to remove all pages of specific relations from the shared buffer.
  The extension was heavily inspired by pg_prewarm and functions as a complementary tool: Whereas pg_prewarm adds pages from a relation to the shared buffer, pg_cooldown removes them again.
  The main purpose of this tool is to easily simulate cold-start scenarios in research.
