Description: A lightweight message queue. Like AWS SQS and RSMQ but on Postgres.
  Postgres Message Queue (PGMQ) -- A lightweight message queue. Like AWS SQS and RSMQ but on Postgres.
  Lightweight - No background worker or external dependencies, just Postgres functions packaged in an extension
  Guaranteed "exactly once" delivery of messages to a consumer within a visibility timeout API parity with AWS SQS and RSMQ
  Messages stay in the queue until explicitly removed. Messages can be archived, instead of deleted, for long-term retention and replayability
