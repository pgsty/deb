Description: PostgreSQL extension that transforms Postgres into a distributed database
 Citus horizontally scales PostgreSQL across commodity servers
 using sharding and replication. Its query engine parallelizes
 incoming SQL queries across these servers to enable real-time
 responses on large datasets.
 .
 Citus extends the underlying database rather than forking it,
 which gives developers and enterprises the power and familiarity
 of a traditional relational database. As an extension, Citus
 supports new PostgreSQL releases, allowing users to benefit from
 new features while maintaining compatibility with existing
 PostgreSQL tools. Note that Citus supports many (but not all) SQL
 commands.
