Description: Text Summarization using LLMs. Built using pgrx
  PostgreSQL is a powerful and versatile database management system.
  One of its strengths lies in its extensibility.
  In this blog, we will explore how to extend PostgreSQL using Rust,
  specifically focusing on creating a custom extension called pg_summarize
  that integrates with the OpenAI API. This extension will include a basic "Hello, pg_summarize!"
  function and another function to summarize text using OpenAI's models.
