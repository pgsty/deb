Description: Scalable, fast, and disk-friendly vector search in Postgres, the successor of pgvecto.rs.
  VectorChord (vchord-bm25) is a PostgreSQL extension designed for scalable, high-performance, and disk-efficient vector similarity search, and serves as the successor to pgvecto.rs.
  With VectorChord, you can store 400,000 vectors for just $1, enabling significant savings: 6x more vectors compared to Pinecone's optimized storage and 26x more than pgvector/pgvecto.rs for the same price1. For further insights, check out our launch blog post.
